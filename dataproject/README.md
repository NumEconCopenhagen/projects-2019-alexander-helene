# Dataproject
This project aims to describe the relationship between income per capita and energy use per capita in South American countries. 
We have used data from the World Bank Development Indicators. The data set consists of 2 variables - GDP per capita (2010 USD) and Energy use (kg of oil equivalent per capita) for 12 countries in the years 1971-2014.

We have structured the data and applied some descriptive calculaltions. Finally we have presented the data in some graphs.
