# Examproject

This exam project is our final answers to the exam questions for ‘Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis’. The project consists of the file ‘exam_2019.ipynb’ and this README.md file.

We have answered 3 questions regarding:
1. Human capital accumulation
2. AS - AD model
3. Exchange economy.

The first question seeks to solve a two period model of an economic agent that is deciding between working or not working. The model is solved in both periods. The solution is illustrated in graphs. We show in an interactive graph if the worker choose to work given different levels of wage and human capital. 

The second question investigates the AS-AD model. We solve for the equilibrium to find the optimal rates of output and inflation. We look at the evolution of the economy and illustrate the effect of a demand disturbance. We simulate the model for 1000 periods under the assumption that supply and demand shocks are stochastic and normally distributed. Finally we plot the correlation between output and inflation with phi as phi changes. We solve for the optimal phi when the correlation is as close to 0.31 as possible.

The third question considers an exchange economy with 3 goods. The preferences are Cobb-DOuglas and the endowments are exponentially distributed. We present budget shares for each of the 3 goods in a histogram and plot the excess demand functions. Applying the given tâtonnement process the equilibrium prices are found. At last the utility distribution in the equilibrium is illustrated. 

To run the code the newest version of scipy is necessary. Please run conda update scipy in your terminal to update your scipy version.
