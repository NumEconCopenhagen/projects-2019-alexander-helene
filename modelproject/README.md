# Modelproject

This project contains an auction model from the paper "James J.D. Wang and Jaime F. Zender. "Auctioning divisible goods"". Due to the complicated nature of dvisible good auctions this project will not cover all the explnations behind the equations as it would be too demanding of the reader. 

Instead this project seeks to showcase the essential equations to which intuitive conclusions can be drawn from the parametric results of the auction. The auction itself could be used in the case of "initial public offerings" (IPO's) to which the intuition will apply.
