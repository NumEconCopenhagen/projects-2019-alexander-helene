# Modelproject

This project contains an auction model from the paper "James J.D. Wang and Jaime F. Zender. "Auctioning divisible goods"". Due to the complicated nature of dvisible good auctions this project will not cover all the explnations behind the equations as it would be too demanding of the reader. 

Instead this project seeks to showcase the essential equations to which intuitive conclusions can be drawn from the parametric results of the auction. The auction itself is adjusted such that it canbe used in a "initial public offering" (IPO) to which the intuition will apply.

The goal of the project is to see how different information given to the bidders affect the expected price of the auction. Further we will investigate to which degree bidders risk-aversion affect the expected price.
